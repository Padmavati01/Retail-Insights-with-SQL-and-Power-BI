## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open your preferred SQL environment (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, DBeaver, etc.).
2. Run the `Retail-SQL-Project.sql` file to execute the necessary commands and create your database.
3. For easy understanding, refer to the `schema.sql` file for table creation and data insertion commands.
4. Use the `Data_querying` file for SQL queries commands that perform analysis and generate insights.

## 📌 Key Analyses Performed

- Total transactions and total revenue
- Gender-based customer distribution
- Monthly sales trend analysis
- Product categories with sales over a threshold
- Highest quantity sold per product category
- Top 10 customers based on total spend
- Gender-wise spending across product categories
- Age-group-wise spending patterns (using CTEs)
- Correlation between customer age, spending, and category
- Year-wise sales comparison (2022 vs 2023)
- Customer segmentation: High vs Low Spenders
- Average price per unit per product category

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

This project also includes a Power BI dashboard for visualizing and presenting the insights derived from the SQL analysis.
